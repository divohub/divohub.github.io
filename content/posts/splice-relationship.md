    <p>Personally, I have a weird relationship with Splice.</p>
    
    <p>Sure, it's cool to have a tool that speeds up your workflow like that. But in the end, we still end up stuck in some kind of template, reusing the same one-shots over and over. That's why, over the years, I've accumulated a ridiculous number of unused credits.</p>

    <p>Buying entire sample packs just doesn't seem worth it to me.</p>

    <p>Using melodic samples from Splice, in my opinion, is straight-up insane. For example, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbOop_za_OY" target="_blank">breakdown</a>.</p>

    <p>Yeah, you can sample, pitch it, slow it down, speed it up, whateverâ€”but using them raw? Not a good idea. Why? Because even if you've paid for a subscription, there's no guarantee you won't get hit with a copyright strike. These samples have been used by beatmakers before you, and Splice doesn't protect you from that.</p>

        Which is weird, right? I thought we were getting royalty-free, cleared samples?

    <h2>The Credit System Problem</h2>
    
    <p>My issue with Splice is how their credit system works.</p>
    
    <p>To me, it's bizarre: you pay for credits, and later you keep paying just to retain access to what you already own. Otherwise, it all just disappears.</p>

    <p>In my humble opinion, subscriptions are the worst thing capitalism ever came up with.</p>
    
    <p>Why can't we just buy credits and use them until we run out? Oh, that's easyâ€”greed.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, that's a key trait of any corporation that makes money off creative professionals.</p>

    <p>Why isn't there an option that's actually loyal to regular working folks?</p>

    <h2>An Alternative Solution</h2>

    <p>Anyway, while I was looking into how to train a neural net on a Splice dataset, I was searching for a library that could work with Splice's API.</p>
    
    <p>And by accident, I stumbled across an alternative frontend for Splice.</p>
    
    <p>No login required. No nagging you to renew your subscription.</p>

    <p>Now, you don't have to pay every month just to keep access to the credits you've already paid for. Browse samples, loops, and one-shots without a subscriptionâ€”and when you're ready, just activate the sub and clear the samples properly, if you're an honest, decent person.</p>

    <p>This client includes all the main features of the official app:</p>
    
    <ul class="feature-list">
        <li data-emoji="ðŸ”Ž">Clean filtering</li>
        <li data-emoji="ðŸŽ§">Search by genre, mood, key, BPM</li>
        <li data-emoji="ðŸŽš">Drag & drop support</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It used to be Windows-only, but I know a lot of people wanted to try itâ€”so I made a small contribution to the project and built a Mac version.</p>
    
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
