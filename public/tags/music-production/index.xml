      <description>Personally, I have a weird relationship with Splice.&#xA;Sure, it&#39;s cool to have a tool that speeds up your workflow like that. But in the end, we still end up stuck in some kind of template, reusing the same one-shots over and over. That&#39;s why, over the years, I&#39;ve accumulated a ridiculous number of unused credits.&#xA;Buying entire sample packs just doesn&#39;t seem worth it to me.&#xA;Using melodic samples from Splice, in my opinion, is straight-up insane.</description>
